As a Software Engineer working for GenAI organization at Google DeepMind, I specialize in developing and refining large multimodal AI models, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside techniques like Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). 
Previously, as part of Google’s Speech Research Team, I contributed to building large-scale Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, with a focus on domain adaptation, data minimization through unsupervised learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, speech personalization, contextualization, and bias mitigation."
